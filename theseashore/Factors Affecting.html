<h1>Zonation: Factors affecting
the distribution of organisms</h1> <p><img src="../images/Shore&#32;profile.jpg" alt="A Shore Profile" width="400" height="292" /></p>
<p>You may have seen this shore profile in the <a href="tidal&#32;diagram.html">tides</a> section. Note the environmental gradient, that is, the gradual change in abiotic (non-living) factors across the habitat. The first factor considered below, desiccation, is the result of the tide. As the water slowly drops so the shore is exposed to drying (called emersion, the opposite of immersion). As you can appreciate, this emersion becomes less the further down the shore you are. On neap tides it may be that days occur when the lower shore never dries out. Likewise, on neaps the upper shore may never get water on some days. This is an environmental gradient of desiccation. The tide is a primary factor as it not only affects the amount of water present but temperature, salinity any many others. </p>
<p>Below is a summary of the main factors which can influence the distribution
of organisms on the seashore.</p>
<p><span class="menuheading">DESICCATION</span> occurs as a result of emersion at low tide; influences the
upper and middle shore.</p>
<p><span class="menuheading">WAVE ACTION</span> more wave action means the water splashes higher and so the zones
occur higher up on the shore. The strong force produced by powerful wave action
will determine not just whether that organism can remain attached to the rock
but also may have an effect on its growth. E.g. <a href="SpeciesPages/Bladderwrack&#32;French.jpg.html">Bladderwrack</a> displays substantial
variation in its shape, size and number of bladders. See <a href="Ballantine.htm">Ballantine's Exposure Scale</a>. </p>
<p><span class="menuheading">LIGHT</span> is needed for photosynthesis. Seaweeds need to be in seawater for
this to occur. However, the water will filter off some of the wavelengths of
light and reduce the intensity. Small algae, e.g. some of the red algae, will
photosynthesise with very little light and occur under other larger algae.
Seaweeds in mid-lower shore require accessory pigments to absorb lower amounts
of light penetrating the water.</p>
<p><span class="menuheading">TEMPERATURE</span>: immersion in water buffers against temperature change. Upper
shore species will have to tolerate the greatest variation in temperature whilst
it has least affect in the lower. High temperatures will increase the affect
of drying out. Increases
salinity in pools</p>
<p><span class="menuheading">ASPECT </span>is the direction the shore faces. South facing will have more illumination
and warmth, but dries faster; north is cooler, darker and less likely to dry
out. Thus, on a north facing slope community bands will be wider and higher up
the shore. <a href="SpeciesPages/Catanella.jpg.html"><em>Catenella</em></a> (red alga) colonises north aspect whilst on south facing
ones
the lichen, Lichina replaces it.</p>
<p><span class="menuheading">SLOPE</span>. A flatter shore may provide a greater area of substrate for colonising
and will not drain as fast as a steeper one.<br/>
</p>
<p><span class="menuheading">TURBIDITY</span> is the cloudiness of the water. Large amounts of plankton can increase
the turbidity, as will detritus and sewage pollution. This restricts the light
reaching the algae on the
rocks.</p>
<p><span class="menuheading">SUBSTRATE</span>. The hardness and size of rocks
and boulders will influence an organisms ability to attach itself. Soft rocks
will be suitable for burrowers, e.g. <a href="SpeciesPages/Additional&#32;Species/Piddock.htm">piddocks</a>.
Large boulders and rocks give good shelter for animals and the angle
of dip of the rock strata may produce more crevices and pools. If stones are
too small
they will be mobile, moving around in the surf and so prevent any organism
from attaching itself to the rock.</p>
<p><span class="menuheading">FRESHWATER</span>. Seepage of water from the cliff
can dilute the seawater. Few
of the organisms on the shore can tolerate salinity changes.
<a href="SpeciesPages/Gutweed.jpg.html"><em>Enteromorpha</em></a> is so
tolerant it is a good indicator of freshwater on rocky shores.
Upper shore rockpools are vulnerable
to salinity variation as water runs off the cliff.</p>
<p><span class="menuheading">BIOTIC. </span>These are the biological factors influencing the community. Algal
turf, like<a href="SpeciesPages/PepperDulse.jpg.html"> <i>Osmundea</i></a> and <i><a href="SpeciesPages/Irish&#32;Moss.jpg.html">Chondrus</a></i>, will slow down the drainage
on the shore and reduce desiccation. Grazing is very important. A high
concentration of <a href="SpeciesPages/Limpets.jpg.html">limpets</a> will reduce the establishment of the normally
dominant brown seaweed.
Removal
of limpets from a shore, e.g. due to oil pollution, results in
a sudden &quot;bloom&quot; of algal growth, usually green. Inter-specific competition
occurs when niches of different species overlap. <a href="SpeciesPages/Knotted&#32;or&#32;Egg&#32;Wrack.jpg.html">Knotted Wrack</a> occupies a similar
position in the middle shore to Bladderwrack. The latter survives wave action
better than the former, which is found on sheltered shores. Where they both occur
competition allows the former to dominate as it lives for many years longer.
The fucoid algae have a &quot;whiplash&quot; affect, where water movement causes
a sweeping action of the alga across the rock and prevents the attachment
of algae spores and the settling of planktonic larvae. In this way it
competes with
barnacles. If the later does manage to become established it may push
out the wrack. Populations cannot become established unless juvenile
forms are available
to colonise the rocks. This is called <b>Supply-side
Ecology</b>. Most organisms living on the shore use the sea to disperse their
young. The seaweeds have microscopic spores and animals like <a href="SpeciesPages/Topshells.html">topshells</a> have larvae
which settle on to the rock to begin growth. If these young are not available
the populations
cannot get established. </p>
