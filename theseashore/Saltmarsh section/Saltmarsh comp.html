<h1>Succession in a Salt Marsh </h1>
<h2>Competition</h2>
<p class="firstpara">What do you need if you're a plant?</p>
<p>Water, light, carbon dioxide, oxygen, nutrients and space,
that's what.</p>
<p>If a whole lot of other species (or a whole lot of your own
species) want these things in the same place and at the same time
as you and there isn't enough of any or all of them to go around
you get <a href="stages&#32;linked&#32;to&#32;salt&#32;marsh/com.html">competition</a>.</p>
<p>Imagine (if you need to) you are a male pop-star. (this isn't
sexism, you have to be a chap for the purposes of this example).
Not for you the modern, healthy, muesli, yoga and caffeine-free
soya milk approach. You are a pop-star in the great 1960s tradition
of drink, drugs, night-clubs, sex, more sex, even more sex, a
quick drink, more sex, a few more drugs and just a bit more sex.............then
you die aged 19 (of a heart attack while having sex).</p>
<p>What have you achieved? Not a lot in musical terms (you were
always drunk or drugged or having sex). You have however spread
your seed far and wide (pre-aids, just pre-oral contraceptives
and you never had time to get to the shops for condoms). You have
however left a <b>lot</b> of offspring behind. In short you have
lived fast and died young. Not something most people would recommend
once they get near to the death age.</p>
<p>Let's imagine an alternative: You are still a male pop-star
but you adopt a different approach. You do the concerts and retire
straight to bed (alone) with a cup of low-fat, sugar-free, caffeine
reduced cocoa. You save all your money and have a hit every year
for decades. Eventually you get around to reproducing which you
do just a couple of times. You live to 122 and leave vast wealth
to your 2 offspring and their children.</p>
<p>In general terms we can think of the competition stage on our
marsh as the &quot;live fast die young species&quot; (opportunistic
species) being replaced by the &quot;nice cup of cocoa, big pension
and live to 122 species&quot; (equilibrium species).</p>
<p>Opportunistic species put most of their energy into fast growth
rapid maturation and production of vast numbers of offspring.
These offspring are spread far and wide. The offspring don't have
much in the way of food reserves. They depend entirely on finding
by chance a suitable habitat. Most of them will die or be eaten
but because of their vast numbers some will survive and within
a short time produce offspring of their own. This approach can
be very successful (think of a dandelion for instance).</p>
<p>Equilibrium species invest more of their energy in long lasting
structures. It may be years before they reach maturity and produce
offspring of their own. They will not make so many offspring and
they may not be so widely dispersed. Each one however will have
protection (say a tough coat or nasty chemicals) and be provided
with a food reserve to ensure a good start in life. This strategy
can also work very well (think of an oak tree).</p>
<p>Pioneers tend towards the opportunistic end of things and equilibrium
species tend towards the long term approach. During the competition
stage of succession our pioneer species will tend to be out-competed
and replaced by equilibrium species.</p>
<p>It's not easy to demonstrate this directly in the field but
we can see species like <i>Spartina </i>and <i>Salicornia </i>replaced
by species like <i><a href="species/Halimione.html">Halimione
portulacoides</a> </i>(sea purslane) and <i><a href="species/Armeria.html">Armeria
</a></i><a name="anchor1305069" id="anchor1305069"></a><i><a href="species/Armeria.html">maritima</a>
</i>(thrift or sea pink).</p>
<p>The number of species continues to increase as abiotic factors
become more favourable. Competitive exclusion would suggest that
where different species are in strong competition one will prevail
at the expense of the other. Leading to our next stage of community
development. You can find out about this by clicking the link.</p>
