<h2>Acorn Barnacles</h2>
<img src="BARNACLE.jpg" alt="Barnacles" width="496" height="333" /></a>
<p class="firstpara">
Barnacles are the sharp little chaps that help you grip on the
slippery seashore and give you a nasty graze on the elbow or knee
when you do slip. There is a lot more to them than that however
and you will discover more if you read on:</p>
<p>Barnacles are crustaceans, relatives of shrimps, crabs and
lobsters. You usually see them at low water when they're closed
up and waiting for the tide to come back in so they do not appear
to do much. If you could see them at high water (or in a tank)
it's a different story. </p>
<p>As the picture above shows they
are actually very dynamic when covered by the sea. They are filter
feeders and those feathery things sticking out of the top are
modified legs which sweep through the water catching food (plankton
and detritus) from the water. The particles are passed to the
mouth which is inside the shell plates. The leg movement also
sets up a current over the gills for respiration and the muscular
contractions serve to circulate the animal's haemolymph (&quot;blood&quot;)
for like the tin man they have no heart. Barnacles start life
as a <a href="Plankton/Barnacle&#32;nauplii.jpg.html">planktonic larvae</a> which settle out on the shore after about
six weeks. The young barnacle wanders about on the shore looking
for a suitable place to attach. Cracks and crevices are attractive
but even better is the presence of other barnacles. Once the animal
has found a good spot it stands on its front end (&quot;head&quot;)
and in an outburst of barnacly <i>joi de vive</i> bashes its head
end on the rock. This causes glue glands to rupture and the animal
is stuck down. It then grows the familiar plates and stays where
it is for the rest of its life (which might be as long as 12 years)
The shells of dead barnacles make favourable microhabitats for
other small animals like the small winkle (<i>Melarhaphe neritoides</i>). </p>
<p><img src="../Resources&#32;for&#32;seashoreweb/Images&#32;for&#32;New&#32;Pages/Chalthamalus.jpg" alt="Chthalamalus" width="300" height="261" /><img src="../Resources&#32;for&#32;seashoreweb/Images&#32;for&#32;New&#32;Pages/Semibalanus.jpg" alt="Semibalanus" width="300" height="321" /></p>
<p>Above: <em>Chthalamalus</em> left, <em>Semibalanus</em>, right. <img src="../Resources&#32;for&#32;seashoreweb/Images&#32;for&#32;New&#32;Pages/Barnacles&#32;cf.jpg" alt="Barnacles" width="300" height="80" /></p>
<p>Probably the commonest species (certainly around Dale Fort in
West Wales) is <i>Semibalanus balanoides</i>. This species has
separate sexes who must copulate to reproduce. You might think
being glued down and surrounded by armour plating would render
this difficult. Indeed it would but for the male barnacle's possession
of a male organ of monstrous proportions. (Were you to multiply
its length up to human proportions we are talking about roughly
20 metres). The males copulate with the females fertilizing up
to 8000 eggs and the females retain the larvae until next Spring
(the season not the tide) when they are released to coincide with
the Spring bloom of phytoplankton (which they feed on). The mighty
organ then surrenders to the way of all flesh and withers away
and the males turn into females for next season. How strange and
exciting is the life of the barnacle. </p>
<p><em>Elminius modestus</em> is a 4 shell-plated species that arrived here from Australasia, in the 1940's. Unlike other barnacles it never seems to stop breeding (it is a cross-breeding hermaphrodite species) and this has resulted in a massive spread across north-west Europe. Also unlike other UK barnacles it has a tolerance of silty water and lower salanity. This means it can do well in estuaries. It is thought that the shell plates are not as tough as those of <em>Chthamalus</em> and <em>Semibalanus</em> and this is why it is not found on wave-exposed shores. It tends to live in the middle shore region of rocky shores. </p>
<p><img src="../Resources&#32;for&#32;seashoreweb/Images&#32;for&#32;New&#32;Pages/Verruca&#32;stroemia.jpg" alt="Verruca stroemia" width="301" height="245" /><em> Verruca stroemia</em>. 4 unequal shell plates and a species found underneath stones in the lower shore; may also be on <em>Laminaria</em> holdfasts. In Scotland they have been seen to cross-fertilise in the winter to release larva in the spring when there is a peak formation of diatoms in the plankton.</p>
<p>Much research has been done on the principle of <strong>Competitive Exclusion</strong> with regard to the two species <em>Chthamalus</em> and <em>Semibalanus</em>. Chthamalus, a southern, warm water species, is tolerant of high temperatures and desiccation. <em>Semibalanus</em>, a northern species does better in cooler, wetter conditions. In the UK we see the northern limit to the <em>Chthamalus</em> range and the southern limit of <em>Semibalanus</em>. Where they overlap and exist together they compete for space on the rock. Where abiotic conditions suit <em>Semibalanus</em> is competitively superior (pushing <em>Chthamalus</em> off the rocks) but <em>Chthamalus</em> wins high up the shore and/or where warmer, drier conditions prevai, e.g. Pembrokeshire exposed shores. </p>
<p>There are several intertidal species in Britain which can be
quite tricky to tell apart although a good text book like <i>A
Student's Guide to the Seashore</i> by Fish and Fish (Cambridge
1996 2nd ed) will enable you to do it.</p>
