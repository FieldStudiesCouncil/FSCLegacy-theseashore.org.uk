<p><font color="#ff0000" size="+4">T Test</font></p>
<p>Strictly speaking what we are about to show you how to do is
a z test for unmatched data. We want to keep things as simple
as we can and as far as examinations boards are concerned this
is a T test.</p>
<p>This test is used to determine whether the arithmetic means
of two sets of data are significantly different to one another.
You need 25+ items of data in each data set and strictly speaking
it should be used with interval data only. If you have big data
sets it can however be used for count-data. It assumes that the
data is normally distributed (symmetrical about the mean)</p>
<p><img src="T&#32;test&#32;heights&#32;of&#32;people&#32;1_files/image002.gif" alt="Heights of people graph" width="558" height="362" border="0" align="bottom" naturalsizeflag="3" />I
f you were to ask the question &quot;Is the mean height of people
in Y Cwm Gwyn significantly different to the mean height of people
in Caerdydd; you would find it easy to answer &quot;yes&quot;.
The shortest person in Y Cwm Gwyn is taller than the tallest person
in Caerdydd. There is no overlap, they are significantly different</p>
<p><img src="T&#32;test&#32;hts&#32;2_files/image002.gif" alt="Mean Heights of people graph" width="542" height="352" border="0" align="bottom" naturalsizeflag="3" />If
you were to ask the same question about people in Caerdydd and
people in Hwlffordd; the answer is not so clear. The means are
much closer together and there is considerable overlap between
the two sets of data. A T test allows you to answer the question
&quot;Are these two means significantly different or not?&quot;
It takes into account the differences between the means and the
amount of overlap of the two sets of data. The null hypothesis
for every T test you will ever do is this:</p>
<p><font color="#ff0000" size="+1">&quot;There is no significant
difference between the means of the two sets of data&quot;</font></p>
<p>To perform a T test we need to know three things about each
set of data:</p>
<p><font color="#0000ff" size="+1">The number</font> of items
in each data set (n) (count them).</p>
<p><font color="#0000ff" size="+1">The mean</font>: Add up all
the individual items of data and divide by the number of items
of data. (= sigma x divided by n)</p>
<p><font color="#0000ff" size="+1">The variance</font> (a measure
of the spread of the data about the mean): Proceed as follows:</p>
<p>1) Add up all your data (you've just done this to work out
the mean) and square the total (= Sigma &nbsp;x-squared)</p>
<p>2) Square each item of data individually and add them up (=
(sigma x)-squared)</p>
<p>3) Stick the numbers in this formula and punch the appropriate
keys on your calculator: (this is where most people go wrong but
we're not going to give you an arithmetic lesson)</p>
<p><img src="variance&#32;formula.jpg" alt="Variance" width="363" height="181" border="0" align="bottom" naturalsizeflag="3" />n is the number
of items of data</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do this for both sets of data and you are in the happy position
of being able to calculate the value of T that is specific to
your data (the calculated value).</p>
<p>Do this using this formula:</p>
<p><img src="t&#32;&#32;formula.jpg" alt="Advanced formula" width="304" height="198" border="0" align="bottom" naturalsizeflag="3" />this may look a bit scary if you've
not seen it before but do not panic, a worked example will follow:</p>
<p>Let us suppose that you are conducting an investigation into
the weight of people in a school. Half the subjects are boys and
half are girls. You think that the boys might have a significantly
bigger mean weight than the girls. You weigh all the individuals
and come up with the following information:</p>
<p>Mean weight (boys) = 54 Kg, variance = 16 (number of measurements
= 25)</p>
<p>Mean weight (girls) = 47 Kg, variance = 19 (number of measurements
= 25)</p>
<p>Calculate the value of T for these two sets of data:</p>
<p><img src="t&#32;formula&#32;with&#32;numbers.jpg" alt="Calculate the value of t" width="380" height="225" border="0" align="bottom" naturalsizeflag="3" />The two vertical
lines mean &quot;ignore the sign of the top number&quot;. It's
the magnitude of the number that counts not whether it is positive
or negative. Now proceed as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="T&#32;test&#32;formulae&#32;and&#32;calcs_files/image001.gif" alt="Explanation of how to calculate the value of t" width="723" height="1043" border="0" align="bottom" naturalsizeflag="3" /></p>
<p>Our calculated value for t is 5.93.</p>
<p>All we have to do now is compare this with the critical value
which we get from a table of critical values of t prepared for
us by cunning statisticians. Here is such a table:</p>
<p><img src="critical&#32;values&#32;of&#32;t.jpg" alt="Critical Value table" width="408" height="636" border="0" align="bottom" naturalsizeflag="0" />First work out how
many degrees of freedom (for a t test this is the total number
of pieces of data minus 2). In our case this is (25 + 25) - 2
= <font size="+2">48</font>. Enter the table at the nearest number
of degrees of freedom to yours. If you're between two values always
take the lower one. This makes it harder for us to beat the critical
value and thus represents a cautious approach. Our appropriate
entry point is therefore 40 degrees of freedom.</p>
<p>Next you have to decide how precise you wish to be in your
acceptance or rejectance of your null hypothesis. Usually we will
pick 5% (see section on &quot;The structure of hypothesis testing
statistics&quot; if you want to know more about this).</p>
<p>Workig down the 5% column and across the 40 degrees of freedom
row we get a critical value of <font size="+2">2.021</font></p>
<p>Our calculated value is <font size="+2">5.93</font></p>
<p>5.93 is bigger than 2.021. In a t test if our calculated value
is bigger than the critical value we reject our null hypothesis.
In rejecting our hypothesis of no difference we are saying that
there is indeed a significant difference between the means of
the two sets of data. In choosing the 5% significance level we
are saying that we would expect to be coreect in accepting or
rejecting our null hypothesis 95% of the time. We might get a
different result due to chance 5% of the time.</p>
<p>Loose talk about such matters can cause spontaneous combustion
in real statisticians but here goes anyway: It's sort of like
saying that you are 95% that you are correct in rejecting the
null hypothesis (or accepting it if your calculated value is smaller
than the critical value).</p>
